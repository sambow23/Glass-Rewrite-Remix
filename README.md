# Remix Stuff
- More shards
- Better impact physics
- Shatter effects

# Glass-Rewrite
A Rewrite of a Garrys Mod Addon created a year ago

## Currently Features:
- Networked shards
- Custom collision
- Ability to set color/material of shards
- Completely procedural
- (Mostly) lag friendly, unfortunately can't do much about laggy source vphysics

## Features needed to be added:
- Network shard data to incoming clients
- Hopefully some vphysics hackery I can do to improve performance with large shard piles
- Different break patterns
- Tool to turn things to glass
- Cool refractive glass material
- (Dupe support?)
